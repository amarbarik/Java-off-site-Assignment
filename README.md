Assignment:
Algorithm
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, write a program to find and print the sum of the even-valued terms.

String and XML manipulation
Consider the attached test.xsd XML schema and input.txt files. Each line in the input file has the following format:

<date YYYY-MM-DD> <time HH:MM> <optional text label>

Write a Java program which reads the contents of the supplied text file, and converts them into an XML document that conforms to the supplied XML Schema. If any line does not match the format, ignore it and proceed to the next line. The output should be written to stdout (System.out).

Answer the following question in English only, do not write code for it. How would you modify the code from question 2, using only standard Java features, to perform a schema validation prior to writing the XML output? What would be the benefits and drawbacks of adding such a step?
